                <p class="text">
                    Holding the title of “longest human-made structure in the world,” the Great Wall is actually many walls running through northern China and southern Mongolia.

                <p class="text">
                    When you go to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, look up. Standing 2,300 feet above the city at the peak of Mount Corcovado, is the hard-to-miss Christ the Redeemer statue. Its size also makes it quite eye-catching. It's 98 feet tall from head to toe (add another 26 feet for the pedestal) and 92 feet wide from fingertip to fingertip of the sculpture's outstretched hands.

                <p class="text">
                    Sometimes called the Lost City of the Incas, Machu Picchu is thought to have been a royal retreat for the Incas in the 15th century before it was mysteriously abandoned. Because it's nestled in the Andes Mountains between two peaks, Machu Picchu went largely unnoticed by European and American explorers for about 400 years.

                    Located in the jungles of Mexico, toward the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, is the abandoned ancient city of Chichén Itzá. More than two million people visit the archeological site annually to get a glimpse into the art, architecture, and science of the Mayan culture.

                <p class="text">
                    One of Italy's most well-known relics, the Colosseum was once the height of entertainment for its famed gladiator contests. It seated 50,000 spectators — more than twice the capacity of New York’s Madison Square Garden — which is only one small reason it's such an architectural marvel.

                <p class="text">
                    Built nearly 400 years ago as a statement of love, the Taj Mahal is thought to be the height of Indian Mughal architecture. It's easily India's most recognizable building. Despite its beauty, the Taj Mahal has suffered years of decay. This is largely due to environmental pollution. Although efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of that pollution, it is slow progress.

                <p class="text">
                    Also known as the Rose City for the red rock it's built from, this ancient Jordanian city was once part of a major trade route. Going by its Greek name meaning “Rock,” Petra is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world and was even referenced in the Bible by the name Sela.
